//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: No, because in the init function, optionals are different types than Strings. When it's an optional, it allows the variable to be either null or a string. the exclamation point forces the variable to be a string, so if you input a null, it will error.

//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: the compiler didn't like the for loop because instantiating i with "let" does not let us change the value later on. Additionally, I changed var elements to let numelements because numelements will remain constant through the entire method.
//: we have to return true if the function runs through the entire for loop and doesn't return false. Furthermore, I also changed it from a regular function to a class function

    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]()
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count

        if lenA != lenB {
            return false

        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**

//: The declaration was incorrect. it was originally using a colon instead of an equals sign and forgot the parenthesis at the end.
//: Instead or return nil, we should return true. I also changed the function from a class function to a regular function. I also changed the lenA and lenB to constants because they are never altered or changed.
